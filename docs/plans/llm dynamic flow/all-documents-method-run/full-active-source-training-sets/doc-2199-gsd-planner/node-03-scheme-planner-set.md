# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: source inventory is present and needs its own handling; metadata and tags is present and needs its own handling; retrieval routing is present and needs its own handling; graph relationships is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for source inventory, metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships. Keep source inventory and metadata and tags separate. Allow retrieval routing and graph relationships to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: source inventory, metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: metadata and tags is present and needs its own handling; retrieval routing is present and needs its own handling; graph relationships is present and needs its own handling; evidence selection is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection. Keep metadata and tags and retrieval routing separate. Allow graph relationships and evidence selection to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.3 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: retrieval routing is present and needs its own handling; graph relationships is present and needs its own handling; evidence selection is present and needs its own handling; quality measurement is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement. Keep retrieval routing and graph relationships separate. Allow evidence selection and quality measurement to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.3 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: graph relationships is present and needs its own handling; evidence selection is present and needs its own handling; quality measurement is present and needs its own handling; hooks is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement, hooks. Keep graph relationships and evidence selection separate. Allow quality measurement and hooks to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement, hooks.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: evidence selection is present and needs its own handling; quality measurement is present and needs its own handling; hooks is present and needs its own handling; posttooluse is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for evidence selection, quality measurement, hooks, posttooluse. Keep evidence selection and quality measurement separate. Allow hooks and posttooluse to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: evidence selection, quality measurement, hooks, posttooluse.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: quality measurement is present and needs its own handling; hooks is present and needs its own handling; posttooluse is present and needs its own handling; matcher write edit is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for quality measurement, hooks, posttooluse, matcher write edit. Keep quality measurement and hooks separate. Allow posttooluse and matcher write edit to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: quality measurement, hooks, posttooluse, matcher write edit.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: hooks is present and needs its own handling; posttooluse is present and needs its own handling; matcher write edit is present and needs its own handling; type command is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for hooks, posttooluse, matcher write edit, type command. Keep hooks and posttooluse separate. Allow matcher write edit and type command to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.7 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: hooks, posttooluse, matcher write edit, type command.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.8 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Hooks:: posttooluse is present and needs its own handling; matcher write edit is present and needs its own handling; type command is present and needs its own handling; command npx eslint fix file 2 dev null true is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for posttooluse, matcher write edit, type command, command npx eslint fix file 2 dev null true. Keep posttooluse and matcher write edit separate. Allow type command and command npx eslint fix file 2 dev null true to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.
