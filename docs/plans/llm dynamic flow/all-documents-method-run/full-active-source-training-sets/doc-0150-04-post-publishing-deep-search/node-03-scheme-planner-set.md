# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Extending the Engine to Support Flow Creation for the event attendance flow and Other 04- Flows: review responsibility is present and needs its own handling; rule coverage is present and needs its own handling; conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for review responsibility, rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation. Keep review responsibility and rule coverage separate. Allow conflict detection and impact explanation to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: review responsibility, rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Extending the Engine to Support Flow Creation for the event attendance flow and Other 04- Flows: rule coverage is present and needs its own handling; conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction. Keep rule coverage and conflict detection separate. Allow impact explanation and reprocess instruction to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

## Pair 3.3 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Extending the Engine to Support Flow Creation for the event attendance flow and Other 04- Flows: conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary. Keep conflict detection and impact explanation separate. Allow reprocess instruction and approval boundary to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Extending the Engine to Support Flow Creation for the event attendance flow and Other 04- Flows: impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; executive summary is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary. Keep impact explanation and reprocess instruction separate. Allow approval boundary and executive summary to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Extending the Engine to Support Flow Creation for the event attendance flow and Other 04- Flows: reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; executive summary is present and needs its own handling; source collection and analysis is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary, source collection and analysis. Keep reprocess instruction and approval boundary separate. Allow executive summary and source collection and analysis to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary, source collection and analysis.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Extending the Engine to Support Flow Creation for the event attendance flow and Other 04- Flows: approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; executive summary is present and needs its own handling; source collection and analysis is present and needs its own handling; available primary sources is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for approval boundary, executive summary, source collection and analysis, available primary sources. Keep approval boundary and executive summary separate. Allow source collection and analysis and available primary sources to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: approval boundary, executive summary, source collection and analysis, available primary sources.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Extending the Engine to Support Flow Creation for the event attendance flow and Other 04- Flows: executive summary is present and needs its own handling; source collection and analysis is present and needs its own handling; available primary sources is present and needs its own handling; unavailable sources that the request assumes exist is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for executive summary, source collection and analysis, available primary sources, unavailable sources that the request assumes exist. Keep executive summary and source collection and analysis separate. Allow available primary sources and unavailable sources that the request assumes exist to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.
