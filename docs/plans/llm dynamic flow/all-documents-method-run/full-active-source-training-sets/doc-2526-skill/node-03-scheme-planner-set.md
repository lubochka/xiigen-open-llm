# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 45: Design Patterns Library: architecture rule is present and needs its own handling; skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice. Keep architecture rule and skill responsibility separate. Allow factory boundary and configuration choice to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 45: Design Patterns Library: skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule. Keep skill responsibility and factory boundary separate. Allow configuration choice and dependency rule to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 45: Design Patterns Library: configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; skill 45 design patterns library is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, skill 45 design patterns library. Keep configuration choice and dependency rule separate. Allow completion gate and skill 45 design patterns library to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, skill 45 design patterns library.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 45: Design Patterns Library: dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; skill 45 design patterns library is present and needs its own handling; overview is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for dependency rule, completion gate, skill 45 design patterns library, overview. Keep dependency rule and completion gate separate. Allow skill 45 design patterns library and overview to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: dependency rule, completion gate, skill 45 design patterns library, overview.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 45: Design Patterns Library: completion gate is present and needs its own handling; skill 45 design patterns library is present and needs its own handling; overview is present and needs its own handling; pattern catalog is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for completion gate, skill 45 design patterns library, overview, pattern catalog. Keep completion gate and skill 45 design patterns library separate. Allow overview and pattern catalog to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: completion gate, skill 45 design patterns library, overview, pattern catalog.
