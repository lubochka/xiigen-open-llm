# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 57: Weight Calculator Service: architecture rule is present and needs its own handling; skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice. Keep architecture rule and skill responsibility separate. Allow factory boundary and configuration choice to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 57: Weight Calculator Service: skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule. Keep skill responsibility and factory boundary separate. Allow configuration choice and dependency rule to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

Pair 3.3 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 57: Weight Calculator Service: configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; skill 57 weight calculator service is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, skill 57 weight calculator service. Keep configuration choice and dependency rule separate. Allow completion gate and skill 57 weight calculator service to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, skill 57 weight calculator service.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 57: Weight Calculator Service: dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; skill 57 weight calculator service is present and needs its own handling; purpose is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for dependency rule, completion gate, skill 57 weight calculator service, purpose. Keep dependency rule and completion gate separate. Allow skill 57 weight calculator service and purpose to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: dependency rule, completion gate, skill 57 weight calculator service, purpose.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 57: Weight Calculator Service: completion gate is present and needs its own handling; skill 57 weight calculator service is present and needs its own handling; purpose is present and needs its own handling; architecture is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for completion gate, skill 57 weight calculator service, purpose, architecture. Keep completion gate and skill 57 weight calculator service separate. Allow purpose and architecture to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: completion gate, skill 57 weight calculator service, purpose, architecture.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 57: Weight Calculator Service: skill 57 weight calculator service is present and needs its own handling; purpose is present and needs its own handling; architecture is present and needs its own handling; machine vs freedom classification is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for skill 57 weight calculator service, purpose, architecture, machine vs freedom classification. Keep skill 57 weight calculator service and purpose separate. Allow architecture and machine vs freedom classification to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.
