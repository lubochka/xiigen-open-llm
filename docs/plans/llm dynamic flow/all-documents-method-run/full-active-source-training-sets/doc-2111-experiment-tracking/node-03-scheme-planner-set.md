# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Experiment Tracking - Complete Guide: architecture rule is present and needs its own handling; skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice. Keep architecture rule and skill responsibility separate. Allow factory boundary and configuration choice to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Experiment Tracking - Complete Guide: configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; experiment tracking complete guide is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, experiment tracking complete guide. Keep configuration choice and dependency rule separate. Allow completion gate and experiment tracking complete guide to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, experiment tracking complete guide.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Experiment Tracking - Complete Guide: dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; experiment tracking complete guide is present and needs its own handling; table of contents is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for dependency rule, completion gate, experiment tracking complete guide, table of contents. Keep dependency rule and completion gate separate. Allow experiment tracking complete guide and table of contents to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: dependency rule, completion gate, experiment tracking complete guide, table of contents.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Experiment Tracking - Complete Guide: completion gate is present and needs its own handling; experiment tracking complete guide is present and needs its own handling; table of contents is present and needs its own handling; why experiment tracking is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for completion gate, experiment tracking complete guide, table of contents, why experiment tracking. Keep completion gate and experiment tracking complete guide separate. Allow table of contents and why experiment tracking to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: completion gate, experiment tracking complete guide, table of contents, why experiment tracking.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Experiment Tracking - Complete Guide: experiment tracking complete guide is present and needs its own handling; table of contents is present and needs its own handling; why experiment tracking is present and needs its own handling; what to track is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for experiment tracking complete guide, table of contents, why experiment tracking, what to track. Keep experiment tracking complete guide and table of contents separate. Allow why experiment tracking and what to track to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.7 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: experiment tracking complete guide, table of contents, why experiment tracking, what to track.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.
