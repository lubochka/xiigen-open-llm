# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: review responsibility is present and needs its own handling; rule coverage is present and needs its own handling; conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for review responsibility, rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation. Keep review responsibility and rule coverage separate. Allow conflict detection and impact explanation to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: review responsibility, rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: rule coverage is present and needs its own handling; conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction. Keep rule coverage and conflict detection separate. Allow impact explanation and reprocess instruction to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.3 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary. Keep conflict detection and impact explanation separate. Allow reprocess instruction and approval boundary to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.3 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; skill 51 questionnaire service is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary, skill 51 questionnaire service. Keep impact explanation and reprocess instruction separate. Allow approval boundary and skill 51 questionnaire service to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary, skill 51 questionnaire service.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; skill 51 questionnaire service is present and needs its own handling; purpose is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for reprocess instruction, approval boundary, skill 51 questionnaire service, purpose. Keep reprocess instruction and approval boundary separate. Allow skill 51 questionnaire service and purpose to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: reprocess instruction, approval boundary, skill 51 questionnaire service, purpose.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; skill 51 questionnaire service is present and needs its own handling; purpose is present and needs its own handling; architecture is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for approval boundary, skill 51 questionnaire service, purpose, architecture. Keep approval boundary and skill 51 questionnaire service separate. Allow purpose and architecture to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: approval boundary, skill 51 questionnaire service, purpose, architecture.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: skill 51 questionnaire service is present and needs its own handling; purpose is present and needs its own handling; architecture is present and needs its own handling; data models dynamic documents is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for skill 51 questionnaire service, purpose, architecture, data models dynamic documents. Keep skill 51 questionnaire service and purpose separate. Allow architecture and data models dynamic documents to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.7 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: skill 51 questionnaire service, purpose, architecture, data models dynamic documents.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.8 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Skill 51: Questionnaire Service: purpose is present and needs its own handling; architecture is present and needs its own handling; data models dynamic documents is present and needs its own handling; questionnaire definition is present and needs its own handling.
