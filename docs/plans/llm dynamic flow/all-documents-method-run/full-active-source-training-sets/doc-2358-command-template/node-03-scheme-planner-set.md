# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: architecture rule is present and needs its own handling; skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice. Keep architecture rule and skill responsibility separate. Allow factory boundary and configuration choice to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule. Keep skill responsibility and factory boundary separate. Allow configuration choice and dependency rule to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.3 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate. Keep factory boundary and configuration choice separate. Allow dependency rule and completion gate to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.3 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; command name is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, command name. Keep configuration choice and dependency rule separate. Allow completion gate and command name to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, command name.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; command name is present and needs its own handling; input is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for dependency rule, completion gate, command name, input. Keep dependency rule and completion gate separate. Allow command name and input to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: dependency rule, completion gate, command name, input.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: completion gate is present and needs its own handling; command name is present and needs its own handling; input is present and needs its own handling; workflow is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for completion gate, command name, input, workflow. Keep completion gate and command name separate. Allow input and workflow to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: completion gate, command name, input, workflow.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: command name is present and needs its own handling; input is present and needs its own handling; workflow is present and needs its own handling; output is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for command name, input, workflow, output. Keep command name and input separate. Allow workflow and output to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.7 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: command name, input, workflow, output.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.8 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for COMMAND NAME: input is present and needs its own handling; workflow is present and needs its own handling; output is present and needs its own handling; error handling is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for input, workflow, output, error handling. Keep input and workflow separate. Allow output and error handling to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.
