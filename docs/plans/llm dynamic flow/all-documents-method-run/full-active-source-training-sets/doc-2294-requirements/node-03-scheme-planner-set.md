# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: source inventory is present and needs its own handling; metadata and tags is present and needs its own handling; retrieval routing is present and needs its own handling; graph relationships is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for source inventory, metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships. Keep source inventory and metadata and tags separate. Allow retrieval routing and graph relationships to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: source inventory, metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: metadata and tags is present and needs its own handling; retrieval routing is present and needs its own handling; graph relationships is present and needs its own handling; evidence selection is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection. Keep metadata and tags and retrieval routing separate. Allow graph relationships and evidence selection to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: metadata and tags, retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.3 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: retrieval routing is present and needs its own handling; graph relationships is present and needs its own handling; evidence selection is present and needs its own handling; quality measurement is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement. Keep retrieval routing and graph relationships separate. Allow evidence selection and quality measurement to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.3 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: retrieval routing, graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: graph relationships is present and needs its own handling; evidence selection is present and needs its own handling; quality measurement is present and needs its own handling; requirements template is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement, requirements template. Keep graph relationships and evidence selection separate. Allow quality measurement and requirements template to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: graph relationships, evidence selection, quality measurement, requirements template.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: evidence selection is present and needs its own handling; quality measurement is present and needs its own handling; requirements template is present and needs its own handling; requirements project name is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for evidence selection, quality measurement, requirements template, requirements project name. Keep evidence selection and quality measurement separate. Allow requirements template and requirements project name to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: evidence selection, quality measurement, requirements template, requirements project name.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: quality measurement is present and needs its own handling; requirements template is present and needs its own handling; requirements project name is present and needs its own handling; v1 requirements is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for quality measurement, requirements template, requirements project name, v1 requirements. Keep quality measurement and requirements template separate. Allow requirements project name and v1 requirements to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: quality measurement, requirements template, requirements project name, v1 requirements.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: requirements template is present and needs its own handling; requirements project name is present and needs its own handling; v1 requirements is present and needs its own handling; authentication is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for requirements template, requirements project name, v1 requirements, authentication. Keep requirements template and requirements project name separate. Allow v1 requirements and authentication to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.7 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: requirements template, requirements project name, v1 requirements, authentication.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.8 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Requirements Template: requirements project name is present and needs its own handling; v1 requirements is present and needs its own handling; authentication is present and needs its own handling; category 2 is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for requirements project name, v1 requirements, authentication, category 2. Keep requirements project name and v1 requirements separate. Allow authentication and category 2 to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.
