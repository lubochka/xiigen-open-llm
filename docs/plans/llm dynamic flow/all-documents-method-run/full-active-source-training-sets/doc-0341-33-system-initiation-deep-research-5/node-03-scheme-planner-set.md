# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: review responsibility is present and needs its own handling; rule coverage is present and needs its own handling; conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for review responsibility, rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation. Keep review responsibility and rule coverage separate. Allow conflict detection and impact explanation to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: review responsibility, rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: rule coverage is present and needs its own handling; conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction. Keep rule coverage and conflict detection separate. Allow impact explanation and reprocess instruction to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: rule coverage, conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.3 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: conflict detection is present and needs its own handling; impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary. Keep conflict detection and impact explanation separate. Allow reprocess instruction and approval boundary to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.3 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: conflict detection, impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: impact explanation is present and needs its own handling; reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; executive summary is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary. Keep impact explanation and reprocess instruction separate. Allow approval boundary and executive summary to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: impact explanation, reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: reprocess instruction is present and needs its own handling; approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; executive summary is present and needs its own handling; assumptions and target outcomes is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary, assumptions and target outcomes. Keep reprocess instruction and approval boundary separate. Allow executive summary and assumptions and target outcomes to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: reprocess instruction, approval boundary, executive summary, assumptions and target outcomes.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: approval boundary is present and needs its own handling; executive summary is present and needs its own handling; assumptions and target outcomes is present and needs its own handling; step documentation as a first class artifact is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for approval boundary, executive summary, assumptions and target outcomes, step documentation as a first class artifact. Keep approval boundary and executive summary separate. Allow assumptions and target outcomes and step documentation as a first class artifact to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: approval boundary, executive summary, assumptions and target outcomes, step documentation as a first class artifact.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: executive summary is present and needs its own handling; assumptions and target outcomes is present and needs its own handling; step documentation as a first class artifact is present and needs its own handling; evidencebundle as immutable run output is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for executive summary, assumptions and target outcomes, step documentation as a first class artifact, evidencebundle as immutable run output. Keep executive summary and assumptions and target outcomes separate. Allow step documentation as a first class artifact and evidencebundle as immutable run output to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.7 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: executive summary, assumptions and target outcomes, step documentation as a first class artifact, evidencebundle as immutable run output.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.8 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Executive summary: assumptions and target outcomes is present and needs its own handling; step documentation as a first class artifact is present and needs its own handling; evidencebundle as immutable run output is present and needs its own handling; visual progress surfaces is present and needs its own handling.
