# Node-03 - Scheme Planner Set

Runtime A is the collection of translated domain statements.
Runtime B is the plan of separated work pieces.

## Pair 3.1 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: architecture rule is present and needs its own handling; skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice. Keep architecture rule and skill responsibility separate. Allow factory boundary and configuration choice to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.1 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: architecture rule, skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.2 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: skill responsibility is present and needs its own handling; factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule. Keep skill responsibility and factory boundary separate. Allow configuration choice and dependency rule to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.2 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: skill responsibility, factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.3 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: factory boundary is present and needs its own handling; configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate. Keep factory boundary and configuration choice separate. Allow dependency rule and completion gate to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.3 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: factory boundary, configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.4 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: configuration choice is present and needs its own handling; dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; phase x name summary minimal is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, phase x name summary minimal. Keep configuration choice and dependency rule separate. Allow completion gate and phase x name summary minimal to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.4 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: configuration choice, dependency rule, completion gate, phase x name summary minimal.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.5 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: dependency rule is present and needs its own handling; completion gate is present and needs its own handling; phase x name summary minimal is present and needs its own handling; performance is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for dependency rule, completion gate, phase x name summary minimal, performance. Keep dependency rule and completion gate separate. Allow phase x name summary minimal and performance to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.5 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: dependency rule, completion gate, phase x name summary minimal, performance.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.6 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: completion gate is present and needs its own handling; phase x name summary minimal is present and needs its own handling; performance is present and needs its own handling; duration time is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for completion gate, phase x name summary minimal, performance, duration time. Keep completion gate and phase x name summary minimal separate. Allow performance and duration time to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.6 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: completion gate, phase x name summary minimal, performance, duration time.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.7 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: phase x name summary minimal is present and needs its own handling; performance is present and needs its own handling; duration time is present and needs its own handling; tasks count is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for phase x name summary minimal, performance, duration time, tasks count. Keep phase x name summary minimal and performance separate. Allow duration time and tasks count to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.7 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: phase x name summary minimal, performance, duration time, tasks count.

B: Plan one branch per responsibility. Preserve order only where one branch needs another branch's result. Keep the merge explicit. Do not hide review, waiting, or repair work inside a general summary.

## Pair 3.8 - Plan Work Pieces

A: Translated domain statements for Phase X : Name Summary Minimal: performance is present and needs its own handling; duration time is present and needs its own handling; tasks count is present and needs its own handling; files modified count is present and needs its own handling.

B: Create work pieces for performance, duration time, tasks count, files modified count. Keep performance and duration time separate. Allow tasks count and files modified count to move in parallel when they do not depend on each other. Add a wait state before merge, a review point before formatting, and a recovery path that sends only the failed fragment back through the flow.

Pair 3.8 - Rephrased

A: The current request has translated responsibilities: performance, duration time, tasks count, files modified count.
